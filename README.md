mediacenter
===========

This project started in September, 2011 and ended in December, 2011, as part of 
a class in computer science in Telecom Bretagne.
This shows the work of two students: Clementine Habay, and Julien Guery (myself).

The aim was to conceive and develope a media centre based on the Apache Tomcat Java Web server, 
using Hibernate persistence framework. A simple web Interface was developed, using Servlets and JSP pages.

This repo can be imported in Eclipse. Don't forget to add to the project build configuration the provided libraries
contained in the libs/ directory.
